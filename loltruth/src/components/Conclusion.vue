    <h3>
        To conclude why i made this website and the app behind it is to show to regular people what i think is crucial information to keep playing the game
        you will most likely and based on data never be a top player otherwise you would of known it before.
        It doesnt mean that the game is bad,
        that esport isnt interesting but just like basketball (since ive already took the comparaison above).
        Playing with friends , alone, for fun, to get better is healthy.
        but dont get it twisted you'll never be in the NBA or you would knew it.
        So search for a more healthy and interesting goal !

    <u><h3>How many times it took get to high elo</h3></u>
    <p>The purpose of this graph is to understand that for most of the top players it didn't took a lot of time to reach
        high elo. Actually as we can see on the graph a huge majority of the high elo player reach high elo (Master,GrandMaster,Challenger),
        in two years of playing the game.
        To have a better appreciation of the graph click on smurfs to desactivate them.
        Based on the data we can guess that even if they are smurfs they could of followed the same rule.
